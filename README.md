# F16 Benchmark Data Analysis

The F16 Benchmark is a GVT on a F16 aircraft carrier. It's primary area of interest is surroudning the nonlinear connection between the wing and the payload. This analysis aims to identify the nonlinearities, quanitfying them where possible. Ultimately, we want to build a model that describes the system dynamics using the given training data.

See 'Nonlinear ground vibration identification of an F-16 aircraft Part I – Fast nonparametric analysis of distortions in FRF measurements' for more details about how the GVT was conducted.

See https://www.nonlinearbenchmark.org/benchmarks/f-16-gvt for the training data.

See 'F16Benchmark.pdf' for further details on the training data and the aim of this analysis.
